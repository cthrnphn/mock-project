# Front End Developer Candidate Mock Project
This project was created as a mock project for a junior developer position. It is a simple single-page web form that is used to submit project or quick-hit web development requests. The form was built using Bootstrap and JQuery, and all scripts and stylesheets are linked to stable versions from Bootstrap/JQuery CDNs. Form input is submitted to the POSTS resource using the JSONPlaceholder mock API, and all form fields are included in body. 

# Getting Started
The project is a single index.html file and is ran locally. Simply open the index.html file with a web browser such as Safari or Chrome.
